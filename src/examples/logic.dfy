/* Review of logical connectives and properties of first-order logic. */

/* We'll be using boolean logic both to define protocols and to state their

 * of logic mean and have a little fluency with manipulating them. */

/* The first section of "An Introduction to Abstract Mathematics" by Neil
 * Donaldson and Alessandra Pantano might be helpful:

/* The core of logic is the _proposition_. For us, a proposition like `2 < 3` is
 * going to be a boolean, with the interpretation that the proposition is true,
 * well, if the boolean is true, and false if not. That proposition is clearly
 * true.

 * proposition.

  // you'll get an error if you uncomment this line
  // assert 7 - 3 == 3;

/* On the other hand something like `7 * false < 8` isn't a
 * proposition at all since it has a type error - we won't have to worry too
 * much about these because Dafny will quickly and easily catch such mistakes.

{
  // you'll get an error if you uncomment this line
  //
  // unlike the above, it will be a type-checking error and not a verification
  // failure

}

/* In Dafny, we can write lemmas with arguments, which are logical variables (of
 * the appropriate types). From here on we'll shift to stating logical properties
 * as ensures clauses of lemmas, the typical way they'd be packaged in Dafny. */

  // The proof of this lemma goes here. In this case (and in many others), no
  // additional assistance is needed so an empty proof suffices.

  // In Dafny, we won't talk much about proofs on their own - in a course on
  // logic you might go over logical rules or proof trees - because Dafny is
  // going to have all the power you need to prove things (as long as they're true!).

/* Let's start by going over the simplest logical connectives: && ("and") and ||
