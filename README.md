# Introduction to Dafny

Short introduction to Dafny as a vehicle for proofs, as well as a reference for
Dafny syntax. Focuses on mathematical objects, so no executable functions,
loops, or heap reasoning.

## Outline

[Lecture 1 (logic)](src/lec1_logic.dfy): lemmas, functions, and assertions

[Lecture 2 (sequences)](src/lec2_sequences.dfy): the built-in sequence data type

[Lecture 3 (algebraic data types)](src/lec3_algebraic_datatypes.dfy): algebraic
data types for user-defined data

[Lecture 3 (advanced topics)](src/lec4_advanced.dfy): an assortment of advanced
topics: opacity/revealing, recursion, and assign-such-that.
